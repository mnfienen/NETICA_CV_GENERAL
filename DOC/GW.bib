   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {45},
   abstract = {In many cases, it has been assumed that the variability in hydrologic parameters can be adequately described through a simple geostatistical model with a given variogram. In other cases, variability may be best described as a series of ‚Äújumps‚Äù in parameter behavior, e.g., those that occur at geologic facies contacts. When using indirect measurements such as pump tests to try to map such heterogeneity (during inverse modeling), the resulting images of the subsurface are always affected by the assumptions invoked. In this paper, we discuss inversion for parameter fields where prior information has suggested that major variability can be described by boundaries between geologic units or facies. In order to identify such parameter fields, we propose a Bayesian level set inversion protocol framework, which allows for flexible zones of any shape, size, and number. We review formulas for defining facies locations using the level set method and for moving the boundaries between zones using a gradient-based technique that improves fit through iterative deformation of the boundaries. We describe the optimization algorithm employed when multiple level set functions are used to represent a field with more than two facies. We extend these formulas to the investigation of the inverse problem in a Bayesian context in which prior information is taken into account and through which measures of uncertainty can be derived. We also demonstrate that the level set method is well suited for joint inversion problems and present a strategy for integrating different data types (such as hydrologic and geophysical) without assuming strict petrophysical relations. Our framework for joint inversion also contrasts with many previous methods in that all data sources (e.g., both hydrologic and geophysical) contribute to boundary delineation at once.},

   abstract = {Flow path delineation is a valuable tool for interpreting the subsurface hydrogeochemical environment. Different types of data, such as groundwater flow and transport, inform different aspects of hydrogeologic parameter values (hydraulic conductivity in this case) which, in turn, determine flow paths. This work combines flow and transport information to estimate a unified set of hydrogeologic parameters using the Bayesian geostatistical inverse approach. Parameter flexibility is allowed by using a highly parameterized approach with the level of complexity informed by the data. Despite the effort to adhere to the ideal of minimal a priori structure imposed on the problem, extreme contrasts in parameters can result in the need to censor correlation across hydrostratigraphic bounding surfaces. These partitions segregate parameters into facies associations. With an iterative approach in which partitions are based on inspection of initial estimates, flow path interpretation is progressively refined through the inclusion of more types of data. Head observations, stable oxygen isotopes (18O/16O ratios), and tritium are all used to progressively refine flow path delineation on an isthmus between two lakes in the Trout Lake watershed, northern Wisconsin, United States. Despite allowing significant parameter freedom by estimating many distributed parameter values, a smooth field is obtained.},

   abstract = {Reactive transport modeling is often used in support of bioremediation and chemical treatment planning and design. There remains a pressing need for practical and efficient models that do not require ( or assume attainable) the high level of characterization needed by complex numerical models. We focus on a linear systems or transfer function approach to the problem of reactive tracer transport in a heterogeneous saprolite aquifer. Transfer functions are obtained through the Bayesian geostatistical inverse method applied to tracer injection histories and breakthrough curves. We employ nonparametric transfer functions, which require minimal assumptions about shape and structure. The resulting flexibility empowers the data to determine the nature of the transfer function with minimal prior assumptions. Nonnegativity is enforced through a reflected Brownian motion stochastic model. The inverse method enables us to quantify uncertainty and to generate conditional realizations of the transfer function. Complex information about a hydrogeologic system is distilled into a relatively simple but rigorously obtained function that describes the transport behavior of the system between two wells. The resulting transfer functions are valuable in reactive transport models based on traveltime and streamline methods. The information contained in the data, particularly in the case of strong heterogeneity, is not overextended but is fully used. This is the first application of Bayesian geostatistical inversion to transfer functions in hydrogeology but the methodology can be extended to any linear system.},

Their effect on model predictions varies in space and time and differs for the flow and solute transport components of a groundwater model. Such errors do not necessarily have any probabilistic properties that can be easily exploited in the construction of a model performance criterion. A Bayesian approach is presented for quantifying model error in the presence of parameter uncertainty. Insight gained in updating the prior information on the model parameters is used to assess the correctness of the model structure, which is defined relative to the accuracy required of the model predictions. Model error is evaluated for each measurement of the dependent variable through an examination of the correctness of the model structure for different accuracy levels. The effect of model error on each dependent variable, which is quantified as a function of location and time, represents a measure of the reliability of the model in terms of each model prediction. This method can be used in identifying possible causes of model error and in discriminating among models in terms of the correctness of the model structure. It also offers an improved description of the uncertainties associated with a modeling exercise that may be useful in risk assessments and decision analyses.},

   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {43},
   number = {5},
   abstract = {[1] Throughout the world, watershed modeling is undertaken using lumped parameter hydrologic models that represent real-world processes in a manner that is at once abstract, but nevertheless relies on algorithms that reflect real-world processes and parameters that reflect real-world hydraulic properties. In most cases, values are assigned to the parameters of such models through calibration against flows at watershed outlets. One criterion by which the utility of the model and the success of the calibration process are judged is that realistic values are assigned to parameters through this process. This study employs regularization theory to examine the relationship between lumped parameters and corresponding real-world hydraulic properties. It demonstrates that any kind of parameter lumping or averaging can induce a substantial amount of "structural noise,'' which devices such as Box-Cox transformation of flows and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling of residuals are unlikely to render homoscedastic and uncorrelated. Furthermore, values estimated for lumped parameters are unlikely to represent average values of the hydraulic properties after which they are named and are often contaminated to a greater or lesser degree by the values of hydraulic properties which they do not purport to represent at all. As a result, the question of how rigidly they should be bounded during the parameter estimation process is still an open one.},

   pages = {1-13},
   abstract = {[1] Pumping tests belong to the most common techniques of hydrogeological site assessment. While the steady state drawdown is determined by the distribution of transmissivity alone, the transient behavior is also influenced by the storativity field. In geostatistical inverse modeling the spatial distributions of both transmissivity and storativity are inferred from the drawdown curves and prior information on the spatial correlation of the parameter fields. So far, however, transient data have hardly been analyzed by geostatistical inverse methods because the computational effort is rather high. In the present study, we characterize the drawdown by its temporal moments. We present moment-generating equations and corresponding equations to compute the sensitivity of the temporal moments of drawdown with respect to the distributions of transmissivity and storativity. We utilize these equations to infer the transmissivity and storativity fields from transient pumping tests using the quasi-linear geostatistical approach of inverse modeling. Considering temporal moments rather than full drawdown curves drastically reduces the computational effort of the estimation procedure. In test cases we show that the first two temporal moments are sufficient to characterize the drawdown curves. We investigate how erroneous assumptions regarding the spatial variability of storativity affect the estimate of the transmissivity field, and we analyze the effect of truncating the measured drawdown curves.

Depth-averaged bulk hydraulic conductivity information was available from previous testing. The three methods deconvolute the vertical profile of lateral hydraulic conductivity. A linear generalized covariance function combined with a zoning approach was used to describe structure. Nonnegativity was enforced by using a power transformation. Data screening prior to calculations was critical to obtaining reasonable results, and the quantified uncertainty estimates obtained by the inverse method led to the discovery of questionable data at the end of the process. The best estimates obtained using the inverse method and kriging compared favorably with first-difference confirmatory calculations, and all three methods were consistent with the geology at the site.},

   abstract = {[1] When an inverse problem is solved to estimate an unknown function such as the hydraulic conductivity in an aquifer or the contamination history at a site, one constraint is that the unknown function is known to be everywhere nonnegative. In this work, we develop a statistically rigorous method for enforcing function nonnegativity in Bayesian inverse problems. The proposed method behaves similarly to a Gaussian process with a linear variogram (i.e., unrestricted Brownian motion) for parameter values significantly greater than zero. The method uses the method of images to define a prior probability density function based on reflected Brownian motion that implicitly enforces nonnegativity. This work focuses on problems where the unknown is a function of a single variable (e. g., time). A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, specifically, a highly efficient Gibbs sampler, is implemented to generate conditional realizations of the unknown function. The new method is applied to the estimation of the trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE) contamination history in an aquifer at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, based on concentration profiles obtained from an underlying aquitard.},

   journal = {Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres},
   volume = {113},
   number = {D21},
   abstract = {This study presents monthly CO2 fluxes from 1997 to 2001 at a 3.75 degrees latitude x 5 degrees longitude resolution, inferred using a geostatistical inverse modeling approach. The approach focuses on quantifying the information content of measurements from the NOAA-ESRL cooperative air sampling network with regard to the global CO2 budget at different spatial and temporal scales. The geostatistical approach avoids the use of explicit prior flux estimates that have formed the basis of previous synthesis Bayesian inversions and does not prescribe spatial patterns of flux for large, aggregated regions. Instead, the method relies strongly on the atmospheric measurements and the inferred spatial autocorrelation of the fluxes to estimate sources and sinks and their associated uncertainties at the resolution of the atmospheric transport model. Results show that grid-scale estimates exhibit high uncertainty and relatively little small-scale variability, but generally reflect reasonable fluxes in areas that are relatively well constrained by measurements. The aggregated continental-scale fluxes are better constrained, and estimates are consistent with results from previous synthesis Bayesian inversion studies for many regions. Observed differences at the continental scale are primarily attributable to the choice of a priori assumptions in the current work relative to those in other synthesis Bayesian studies. Overall, the results indicate that the geostatistical inverse modeling approach is able to estimate global fluxes using the limited atmospheric measurement network without relying on assumptions about a priori estimates of the flux distribution. As such, the method provides a means of isolating the information content of the atmospheric measurements, and thus serves as a valuable tool for reconciling top-down and bottom-up estimates of CO2 flux variability.},

   abstract = {In many geostatistical applications, spatially discretized unknowns are conditioned on observations that depend on the unknowns in a form that can be linearized. Conditioning takes several matrix-matrix multiplications to compute the cross-covariance matrix of the unknowns and the observations and the auto-covariance matrix of the observations. For large numbers n of discrete values of the unknown, the storage and computational costs for evaluating these matrices, proportional to n 2, become strictly inhibiting. In this paper, we summarize and extend a collection of highly efficient spectral methods to compute these matrices, based on circulant embedding and the fast Fourier transform (FFT). These methods are applicable whenever the unknowns are a stationary random variable discretized on a regular equispaced grid, imposing an exploitable structure onto the auto-covariance matrix of the unknowns. Computational costs are reduced from O (n(2))to O (n log(2) n) and storage requirements are reduced from O (n(2)) to O (n).},

   journal = {Water Resources Research},
   volume = {31},
   number = {3},
   pages = {475-493},
   abstract = {A new methodology for solution of the inverse problem in groundwater hydrology is proposed and applied to a site in southeastern New Mexico with extensive hydrogeologic data. The methodology addresses the issue of nonuniqueness of the inverse solutions by generating an ensemble of transmissivity fields considered to be equally likely, each of which is in agreement with the measured transmissivity and pressure data. It consists of generating a selected number of conditionally simulated transmissivity fields and then calibrating each of the fields to match the measured steady state or transient pressures, in a least squares sense. The calibration phase involves an iterative implementation of an automated pilot point approach coupled with conditional simulations. Pilot points are the parameters of calibration. They are synthetic transmissivity data which are added to the transmissivity database to produce a revised conditional simulation during calibration. Coupled kriging and adjoint Sensitivity analysis is employed for the optimal location of pilot points, and gradient search methods are used to derive their optimal transmissivities. The pilot point methodology is well suited for characterizing the spatial variability of the transmissivity field in contrast to methods using zonation. Pilot points are located where their potential for minimizing the objective function is the highest. This minimizes the perturbations in the transmissivities which are optimally assigned to the pilot point and results in minimal changes to the covariance structure of the transmissivity field. The calibrated fields honor the transmissivity measurements at their locations, preserve the variogram, and match the measured pressures in a least squares sense. Since there are numerous options in the execution of this methodology, computational experiments have been conducted to identify the most efficient among them. The method has been applied to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site, in southeastern New Mexico, where the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting probabilistic system assessment for the permanent disposal of transuranic nuclear waste. The resulting calibrated transmissivity fields are input to a Monte Carlo analysis of the total system performance. The present paper, paper 1 of a two-paper presentation, describes the methodology. Paper 2, a companion paper, presents the methodology's application to the WIPP site.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a geostatistical approach to multi-directional aquifer stimulation in order to better identify the transmissivity field. Hydraulic head measurements, taken at a few locations but under a number of different steady-state flow conditions, are used to estimate the transmissivity. Well installation is generally the most costly aspect of obtaining hydraulic head measurements. Therefore, it is advantageous to obtain as many informative measurements from each sampling location as possible. This can be achieved by hydraulically stimulating the aquifer through pumping, in order to set-up a variety of flow conditions. We illustrate the method by applying it to a synthetic aquifer. The simulations provide evidence that a few sampling locations may provide enough information to estimate the transmissivity field. Furthermore, the innovation of, or new information provided by, each measurement can be examined by looking at the corresponding spline and sensitivity matrix. Estimates from multi-directional stimulation are found to be clearly superior to estimates using data taken under one flow condition. We describe the geostatistical methodology for using data from multi-directional simulations and address computational issues.},
